# Printing-Hello-World
This was one of my first and most fun Python projects. One day, while scrolling through Instagram reels, I came across a small Python project that printed input text with a fancy raining effect. I thought it looked cool and decided to recreate it. After experimenting, I ended up with this final code. I know it's not very professional, but hey, what can you expect from a first-semester learner?
